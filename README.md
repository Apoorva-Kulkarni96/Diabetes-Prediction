### Diabetes-Prediction
A system is build using Machine learning algorithm to predict whether a person is suffering from Diabetes or not. The data collected has various features like Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age, etc, with which model is trained and tested  and outcome is obtained and evaluated. A Predictive System is build to check for individual observations. All the required files are attached.

#### Steps Involved 

1. Import Libraries
2. Reading Data
3. EDA
4. Data Preparation
5. Standardize the data
6. Train Test Split
7. Model Implementataion- SVC 
8. Predictive System

### Tools Used

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit Learn


#### Conclusion:

From the given dataset we could see that number of people suffering from Diabetes are 268 and number of people not suffering from Diabetes are 500. By taking mean of all columns present in dataset, we can infer that Glucose level and Insulin Level is considerably high in people those are suffering from Diabetes.

After evaluation, we could see that 78% the model predict correctly. 119 times out of 154 test case, the model has given correct predicton.
